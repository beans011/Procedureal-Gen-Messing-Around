THING I WANT TO DO NEXT: MAKE MOUNTAINS SPAWN AND THEN CAVES THAT LEAD TO OTHER PARTS OF MAP

FOR NEXT THING: split each biome into each having its own 2d array to store points then apply its own type of biome generation which will stay the same (no randomness)

STUFF TO DO:
ADD MORE BIOMES
CAVES
STRUCTURES

BIOMES:
frozen ocean - can walk on
deep ocean
less deep ocean
beach
grassland
Normal forest
tundra
snowy mountains
coral ocean
desert
mesa
mangroves
swamp
jungle
HELL aka volcano

STRUCTURES:
Probably gonna be seperate instances/scenes or off screen places
Gonna have like portals/entrances on surface

TRY USING CELLULAR AUTOMATA FOR CAVES
TRY MAKING SETROOMS AND THEN LINKING THEM FOR DUNGEONS
